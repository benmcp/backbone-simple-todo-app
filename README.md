# Simple base

Basically I've been doing various variants of default product setups, this is an attempt to unify (mainly the front end) to a convention that seems to be used by others.

NB: was meant to grunt, but reverted to gulp due to soul destroying bug.

## To set up

npm insatll

bower install

gulp build

cd dist

php -S localhost:1234
